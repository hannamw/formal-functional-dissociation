# formal-functional-dissociation
This repo hosts the code for the paper *Are formal and functional language mechanisms dissociated?*. To replicate the results, just:
1. Create a conda environment using the `environment.yml` file.
2. Install the `eap` library from the `EAP-IG` folder.
3. Run the scripts in `scripts/`. 
4. Create the figures using the outputs in `results/`.

More info coming soon!
